Web application for inventory using zUIx JavaScript Library, Material Design Lite and BarcodeReader v2.0 *(many thanks to iemadk for an easy-working barcode scanner solution - iemadk.github.io/barcode-reader)*

Student project for me at Jentekoderne, the original idea comes from @devoldski

*main goal: learning how to build a more complex web application and also applying JavaScript (still spaghetti-ish)*
